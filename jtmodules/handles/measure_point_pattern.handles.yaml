        Objects in "ref_objects" and "extract_objects" must have a one-to-many
        relationship, i.e. objects in "ref_objecs" must contain those in
        "extract_objects".

      type: SegmentedObjects
      key:
      help: >
        Labeled image with registered objects to which point pattern features
        should be assigned. "extract_objects" and "assign_objects" must either
        have a one-to-one or a many-to-one relationship and "extract_objects"
        must further be fully contained by "assign_objects".

        Do feature values need to be aggregated? Values must be scalars, so in
        case "extract_objects" and "assign_objects" have a many-to-one
        relationship aggregation must be performed.
