    '''Measures texture features for objects in `extract_objects` based
    on grayscale values in `intensity_image` and assign them to `assign_objects`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extract_objects: numpy.ndarray[int32]
        label image with objects for which features should be extracted
    assign_objects: numpy.ndarray[int32]
        label image with objects to which extracted features should be assigned
    intensity_image: numpy.ndarray[unit8 or uint16]
        grayscale image from which features should be extracted
    aggregate: bool, optional
        whether measurements should be aggregated in case `extract_objects`
        and `assign_objects` have a many-to-one relationship
    frequencies: Set[int], optional
        frequencies of the Gabor filters (default: ``{1, 5, 10}``)
    measure_TAS: bool, optional
        whether *Threshold Adjacency Statistics (TAS)* features should
        be extracted
    measure_LBP: bool, optional
        whether *Local Binary Patterns (LBP)* should be extracted
    radii: Set[int], optional
        radii for defining pixel neighbourhood for Local Binary Patterns
        (LBP) (default: ``{1, 5, 10}``)
    scales: Set[int], optional
        scales at which to compute the Haralick textures
    measure_haralick: bool, optional
        whether *Haralick* features should be extracted
    plot: bool, optional
        whether a plot should be generated (default: ``False``)
