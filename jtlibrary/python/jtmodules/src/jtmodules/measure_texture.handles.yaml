        Labeled image with registered objects to which texture features
        should be assigned. "extract_objects" and "assign_objects" must either
        have a one-to-one or a many-to-one relationship and "extract_objects"
        must be fully contained by "assign_objects".

        Greyscale image from which texture features should be extracted, i.e.
        whose pixel values should be used for the measurement.

        Do feature values need to be aggregated? Values must be scalars, so in
        case "extract_objects" and "assign_objects" have a many-to-one
        relationship aggregation must be performed.
