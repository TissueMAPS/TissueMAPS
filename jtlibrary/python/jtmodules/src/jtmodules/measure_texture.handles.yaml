        Labeled image with registered objects to which texture features
        should be assigned. "extract_objects" and "assign_objects" must either
        have a one-to-one or a many-to-one relationship and "extract_objects"
        must be fully contained by "assign_objects".

        Greyscale image from which texture features should be extracted, i.e.
        whose pixel values should be used for the measurement.

      help: >
        Do feature values need to be aggregated? Values must be scalars, so in
        case "extract_objects" and "assign_objects" have a many-to-one
        relationship aggregation must be performed.
