def main(primary_label_image, intensity_image, contrast_threshold,
        min_threshold=None, max_threshold=None, plot=False):
    '''Detects secondary objects in an image by expanding the primary objects
    encoded in `primary_label_image`. The outlines of secondary objects are
    determined based on the watershed transform of `intensity_image` using the
    primary objects in `primary_label_image` as seeds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    primary_label_image: numpy.ndarray[numpy.int32]
        2D labeled array encoding primary objects, which serve as seeds for
        watershed transform
    intensity_image: numpy.ndarray[numpy.uint8 or numpy.uint16]
        2D grayscale array that serves as gradient for watershed transform;
        optimally this image is enhanced with a low-pass filter
    contrast_threshold: int
        contrast threshold for automatic separation of forground from background
        based on locally adaptive thresholding (when ``0`` threshold defaults
        to `min_threshold` manual thresholding)
    min_threshold: int, optional
        minimal foreground value; pixels below `min_threshold` are considered
        background
    max_threshold: int, optional
        maximal foreground value; pixels above `max_threshold` are considered
        foreground
    plot: bool, optional
        whether a plot should be generated

    Returns
    -------
    jtmodules.segment_secondary.Output

    Note
    ----
    Setting `min_threshold` and `max_threshold` to the same value reduces
    to manual thresholding.
