    and assign them to `assign_objects`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extract_objects: numpy.ndarray[int32]
        label image with objects for which features should be extracted
    assign_objects: numpy.ndarray[int32]
        label image with objects to which extracted features should be assigned
    aggregate: bool, optional
        whether measurements should be aggregated in case `extract_objects`
        and `assign_objects` have a many-to-one relationship
    measure_zernike: bool, optional
        whether *Zernike* moments should be extracted
    plot: bool, optional
        whether a plot should be generated (default: ``False``)

    Returns
    -------
